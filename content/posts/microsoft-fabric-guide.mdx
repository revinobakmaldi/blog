## What is Microsoft Fabric?

Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that brings together data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence into a single unified experience. It's built on top of OneLake — a single, unified data lake for the entire organization.

## Why Analytics Engineers Should Care

If you've been juggling Snowflake, dbt, Airflow, and a BI tool, Fabric consolidates much of that stack. Here's what makes it compelling:

- **OneLake**: One copy of data, accessible by all engines
- **Lakehouse architecture**: Combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses
- **Built-in notebooks**: Spark-based notebooks for transformation
- **Dataflows Gen2**: Low-code ETL that actually works
- **Direct Lake mode**: Power BI reads from the lakehouse without imports

## Setting Up Your First Lakehouse

### 1. Create a Workspace

Navigate to the Fabric portal and create a new workspace. Choose the **Fabric capacity** tier that matches your needs.

```python
# Example: Reading from OneLake with PySpark
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("Tables/sales_fact")
df.show()
```

### 2. Ingest Data

Use **Dataflows Gen2** or **Data Pipelines** to bring data into your lakehouse. Fabric supports connections to 150+ data sources.

### 3. Transform with Notebooks

Fabric notebooks run on Apache Spark. You can write PySpark, Spark SQL, or even use the visual query builder:

```sql
-- Create a curated view for reporting
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW gold.monthly_revenue AS
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM silver.orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

### 4. Build Reports with Direct Lake

Direct Lake mode lets Power BI read directly from Delta tables in your lakehouse — no import, no DirectQuery latency.

## Key Takeaways

1. Fabric reduces tool sprawl for analytics teams
2. OneLake eliminates data silos and redundant copies
3. The lakehouse pattern gives you warehouse performance on lake storage
4. Direct Lake mode is a game-changer for Power BI performance
